## My personal Portfolio website
The first version of this page stemmed out of a course CS6.201CS6.201 "Introduction to Software Systems" I took as a fresher, during my undergrad at IIITH, and comprised primarily of basic HTML, CSS, and very little Javascript
It has undergone many changes since then. For the first version, you may visit https://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~raunak.seksaria/  

It is currently build using next.js

## Deployed:
A version of this is deployed on Github Pages, which is on the **gh-pages** branch of this repository.


## Getting Started

To get the current version, run 
```
npm run dev
```
