## My personal Portfolio website
The first version of this page stemmed out of a course CS6.201CS6.201 "Introduction to Software Systems" I took as a fresher, during my undergrad at IIITH, and comprised primarily of basic HTML, CSS, and very little Javascript
It has undergone many changes since then. For the first version, you may visit https://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~raunak.seksaria/


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
